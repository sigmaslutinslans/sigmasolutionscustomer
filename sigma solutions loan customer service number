A Payday Alternative Loan (PAL) is offered by some credit unions to help its members avoid the pratfall of a payday loan. All credit unions that are members of the National Credit Union Administration offer these loans, but the borrower must be a member of the credit union.

These loans charge an application fee of up to $20 and allow those in financial straits to borrow between $200 and $1,000. Interest rates typically mirror those of credit cards. Thatâ€™s not low, but is mitigated by the short timeframe to repay. Loans can be set up to repay in 1-3 months, and borrowers may set up three PALs in a six-month timeframe, provided no PAL overlaps or is rolled over.

These loans cost less than payday loans, yet still provide fast cash. Given the option of a PAL or a payday loan, the answer is easy: Take advantage of your credit union and the PAL. You could even use the PAL to pay off a payday loan.
