This is an excellent option for those who belong to a credit union, which is a not-for-profit financial institution owned by members that provides many of the same services as a bank.

A credit union may actually offer the best interest rate and lowest payment, provided the borrower is a member. Don’t merely assume the rate will be the best, though. Shop different institutions, including banks, to see the rate and monthly payment for what is borrowed.

The credit union will consider credit score and personal income as well as your history as a member when deciding on a loan. The loan won’t be free the way a charity grant or assistance may be, but it is a far better option than payday loans.
